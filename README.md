We maintain a list that facilitates players & developers access to Autonomous Worlds  & Fully On-Chain Games.



The information we organize may be incomplete or outdated, welcome to pull a request to maintain this list in community way.



The list is still being compiled, welcome to stay tuned.



### The basic rules

1. Active projects/guilds related to Autonomous Worlds.
2. Projects should have demo or GitHub repo.
3. Guilds should build some projects on Github or publish some tools for players to use.



If you want to add your projects & teams info, please feel free to pull a request, we will respond as soon as possible. 

We reserve the right to add your projects/guilds to our list or not.

 Welcome to maintain your own listings using our code as a template, we'd love to help.



### How To Add Info 

open constants/index.tsx to add info,

open public/images/worldlogo/ to add logo.



## Todo List

1. add more projects/guilds in mud & dojo ecosystems.
2. modify the display style so that the logo appears in a random way.
3. Add more docs  to make it easier for others to use the code as a template.
